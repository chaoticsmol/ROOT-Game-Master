Your answers prioritize precision, accuracy and conciseness.`,
  gameMasterAppearance: `The game master is a wise, old entity and an embodiment of the woodlands.
  
Their features resemble that of an old witch. While they are somewhat rugged in appearance, they are also quite beautiful and elegant.

The game master sits at a beautiful wooden table in a clearing. Surrounding the clearing are many evergreen trees.  Some of these trees are more yellow in color, while some are more orange and some are more red.

It is twilight where the game master is seated. Behind them, a river runs off to the side, reflecting the colors of the darkening sky. Stars are just beginning to peak through the clouds.`,
